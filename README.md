# NeuroSynth Behavioral fMRI Analysis
## NeuroSynth Description
Neurosynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

Neurosynth takes thousands of published articles reporting the results of fMRI studies, chews on them for a bit, and then spits out images that look like this:

## Research Results

### Research Analysis Introduction
In this Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience research project, I utilized neurosynth to further study the connection between multiple cognitive / behavioral  patterns (Addiction, Anxiety), 
and then utilizing neurosynth was able to write up the fMRI neueroanotmoical connection to such cogntive processes.

### Research Results

### Addiction

#### Ventral Striatum (Addiction)

Various studies have shown that the ventral striatum is highly involved in addictive behaviors. One of the
reasons that the ventral striatum is so heavily involved in addiction is because the ventral striatum receives
glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the orbitofrontal 
cortex. These frontal areas increase their glutamatergic input to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), 
when the drug user is presented with a drug use mental cue; simultaneously there is a decrease in neural 
plasticity, partially explaining the formation of addictions.
