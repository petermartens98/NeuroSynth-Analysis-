# NeuroSynth Behavioral fMRI Analysis
# Research Results

## Research Analysis Introduction
In this Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience research project, I utilized neurosynth to further study the connection between multiple cognitive / behavioral  patterns (Addiction, Anxiety), 
and then utilizing neurosynth was able to write up the fMRI neueroanotmoical connection to such cogntive processes.

## NeuroSynth Description
Neurosynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

Neurosynth takes thousands of published articles reporting the results of fMRI studies, chews on them for a bit, and then spits out images that look like the ones included below.

## Addiction

### Ventral Striatum (Addiction)

Various studies have shown that the ventral striatum is highly involved in addictive behaviors. One of the
reasons that the ventral striatum is so heavily involved in addiction is because the ventral striatum receives
glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the orbitofrontal 
cortex. These frontal areas increase their glutamatergic input to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), 
when the drug user is presented with a drug use mental cue; simultaneously there is a decrease in neural 
plasticity, partially explaining the formation of addictions.

### Ventral Tegmental Area (in midbrain) (Addiction)

Many studies have shown that the ventral tegmental area is implicated in reward seeking and also drug
seeking behavior. This is because the ventral tegmental area is the origin of dopaminergic cell bodies within 
the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, as well as other dopamine pathways. The ventral tegmental area is 
largely implicated in the regulation of the distribution of dopamine within the brain, such as the frontal cortex 
and the caudal brainstem. With its role in distributing dopamine throughout the brain it is easy to imagine 
how the ventral tegmental area is highly implicated with addictive behaviors.

### Posterior Cingulate Cortex (Addiction)

In an experiment of 14 male chronic heroine users, compared to 14 healthy control subjects. Participants were 
put into an fMRI scanner and a cue-induced craving task was presented. Within the chronic heroine use group, 
there was higher functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex and with longer duration of heroine 
having a positive correlation with increased posterior cingulate cortex activation. In another experiment, 30 
cigarette smokers and 30 nonsmokers were put into an fMRI scanner and were presented with a smoking cue
and mental simulation, more specifically smoking hand movements. In the smoker group, there was increased 
functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex, in response to smoking hand mental simulations.
Both studies exemplify the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in the context of addiction.

## Anxiety 
### Amygdala (Anxiety)

The amygdala is located within the limbic system of the brain and is involved in decision making, emotional 
responses and the fight or flight response; with these functions of the amygdala and limbic system in mind, its 
easy to imagine how the amygdala may be implicated in anxiety disorders. Researchers from Stanford were 
also able to study adolescent brains and were able to predict how anxious they are based on the size and 
functional connectivity of the amygdala. And they found that a larger amygdala correlated with more anxiety, 
further showing the amygdala’s role in anxiety.

### Posterior Insular Cortex (Anxiety)

In mice models, through the use of optogenetics, researchers were able to identify a pathway from the insula 
to the amygdala which mediates anxiety. This is significant because the amygdala is highly implicated in 
emotional responses and anxiety disorders. These same researchers were also able to show in mice that the 
posterior insular cortex is involved in processing aversive sensory stimuli, bodily and emotional states, as well 
as even shifting one’s behavior based on these states and stimuli. These findings support the notion that the 
posterior insular cortex is implicated in anxiety disorders because of how involved it is in processing aversive 
stimuli.

### Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (Anxiety)

In humans, it has been shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a big role in regulating amygdala 
activity, which is also highly involved in anxiety. It has also been shown that the ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex plays an active role in regulating the fear response, largely through its role in context learning and 
forming associations. Both of these studies support the idea that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a 
role in regulating anxiety.
